__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value.__

## QUESTION|TASK 2

Which airport has the worst delays? Discuss the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.

The aiport with the worst delay is Chicago,IL: Chicago O'Hare International. On average throughout each month it is delayed 6,955 hours in delayed time. 

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
flights['Proportion of Delayed Flights'] = flights['num_of_delays_total'] / flights['num_of_flights_total']

flights['hours_delayed'] = (flights.minutes_delayed_total / 60).round()

airport_counts = flights['airport_name'].value_counts()

summary_table = flights[['airport_name', 'num_of_flights_total', 'num_of_delays_total', 'Proportion of Delayed Flights', 'hours_delayed']]

summary_table = summary_table.merge(airport_counts.rename('Repeat Airports'), left_on='airport_name', right_index=True)

grouped_summary = summary_table.groupby('airport_name').agg({
    'num_of_flights_total': 'sum',
    'num_of_delays_total': 'sum',
    'Proportion of Delayed Flights': 'mean',
    'hours_delayed': 'mean',
    'Repeat Airports': 'sum'
})

summary_table_sorted = grouped_summary.sort_values(by='hours_delayed', ascending=False)

summary_table_sorted.head()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 3

What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Discuss the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)

The best time to fly would be in the month of November. The delays of flight per hour are the smallest out of the rest of the year. The reason I chose to go with delay of time in hours is because amercans use hours to gage time rather than minutes. We think in how many hours it is going to take us to do something or how long of a delay it will be.

```{python}
#| label: Q3
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
flights_filtered = flights.dropna(subset=['month'])

average_delay_per_month = flights_filtered.groupby('month')['hours_delayed'].mean().reset_index()

fig = px.line(average_delay_per_month, x='month', y='hours_delayed',
             title='Average Delay Time by Month',
             labels={'hours_delayed': 'Average Delay Time (hours)'},
             color_discrete_sequence=['skyblue'])
fig.update_layout(xaxis=dict(tickangle=45),
                  yaxis=dict(title='Average Delay Time (hours)'),
                  plot_bgcolor='rgba(0,0,0,0)')
fig.show()

```

## QUESTION|TASK 4

According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:__

100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather

30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather.

From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%.

<!-- _type your results and analysis here_ -->

```{python}
#| label: Q4
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
weather = (flights.assign(
    severe = flights.num_of_delays_weather, # no missing
    nodla_nona = lambda x: (x.num_of_delays_late_aircraft
        .replace(-999, np.nan)), #missing is -999
    mild_late = lambda x: x.nodla_nona.fillna(x.nodla_nona.mean())*0.3,
    mild = np.where(
        flights.month.isin(['April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August']), 
            flights.num_of_delays_nas*0.4,
            flights.num_of_delays_nas*0.65),
    weather = lambda x: x.severe + x.mild_late + x.mild,
    proportion_weather_delay = lambda x: x.weather / x.num_of_delays_total,
    proportion_weather_total = lambda x:  x.weather / x.num_of_flights_total)
    .filter(['airport_code','month','year', 'severe','mild', 'mild_late',
    'weather', 'proportion_weather_total', 
    'proportion_weather_delay', 'num_of_flights_total', 'num_of_delays_total']))
weather.head()

```

## QUESTION|TASK 5

Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Discuss what you learn from this graph.

More flights are delayed due to weather in Orlando and San Francisco.

```{python}
#| label: Q5
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
fig = px.bar(weather, x='airport_code', y='proportion_weather_delay',
             title='Proportion of Flights Delayed by Weather Per Airport',
             labels={'proportion_weather_delay': 'Proportion of Delayed Flights by Weather'},
             color='airport_code',
             color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Safe)

fig.update_layout(xaxis_title='Airport Code', yaxis_title='Proportion of Delayed Flights by Weather')

fig.show()
